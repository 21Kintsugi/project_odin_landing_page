                <h2>In my youth, I courted war. War has made me who I am. I am the sum of all the battles I have fought, across countless worlds. I am the son of Odin, the rightful king of Asgard, and the protector of the Nine Realms. But I have cast aside the throne. That duty has fallen to my brother, Loki. He, who put the needs of others before himself. He, who, in the end, will always step up to be the hero. Like the sun, we are born to perpetual dawn, and so, as long as there is life, there will be a dawn, Marvelous Man</h2>
